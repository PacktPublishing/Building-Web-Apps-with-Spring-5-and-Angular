## About the Book
Spring is the most popular application development framework being adopted by millions of developers around the world to create high performing, easily testable, reusable code. Its lightweight nature and extensibility helps you write robust and highly-scalable server-side web applications. Coupled with the power and efficiency of Angular, creating web applications has never been easier.

## Instructions and Navigation
All of the code is organized into folders. Each folder starts with a number followed by the application name. For example, Chapter02.

Readers can refer to the full source code (Spring and Angular) for the HealthApp developed across the book. The source code is provided with this code bundle.

The code will look like the following:
```
@RequestMapping("/")
String home() {
    return "Hello world. How are you?";
}
public static void main(String[] args) {
    SpringApplication.run(HelloWorldApplication.class, args);
}
```

To execute the codes in this book and run the application, you will need to have Java, Angular, Docker, Jenkins, and GitLab configured in your system. You will also require JavaScript IDEs and Eclipse for developing codes in Java, Spring, Hibernate, and Angular.
